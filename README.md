## **UX**

### **User Story**
A person interested in space wants to test their knowledge of the subject by doing a fun quiz. Once the quiz is done, the user can redo the quiz to get a higher score or challenge family and friends to try to beat him. 

### **Goals For Website Owners** 
The goal of the website is to entertain the user with a quiz. It provides the user with spacerelated questions to give the user a challenge in their area of interest. The user will also leave the quiz with a new knowledge. 

### **Wireframe** ###
Was inspired by this design when I built spaceQuiz.
